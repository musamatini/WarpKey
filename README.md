# üéâ WarpKey: Your Mac's Productivity Power-Up! üöÄ

### Blazing-Fast App Switching & Window Management at Your Fingertips.

Welcome to WarpKey, a sleek and intuitive macOS utility designed to revolutionize how you interact with your applications. Forget hunting through your Dock‚Äîassign a unique hotkey to an app to instantly launch it or bring it to the front. Press the hotkey again to hide the app, clearing your workspace in a flash. For power users, WarpKey can also cycle through all open windows of a single application, making it effortless to find exactly what you need. It runs discreetly from your menu bar and starts at login, so your shortcuts are always ready.

This project is a labor of love, built with üíö SwiftUI, and it represents my journey as a junior developer diving deep into the world of open-source macOS app development. Your feedback and support mean the world!

## üöÄ Getting Started with WarpKey

It's incredibly simple to set up your first shortcut:

1.  **Launch WarpKey.** (You can access its settings from the menu bar icon).
2.  Bring the application you wish to assign a shortcut to into focus (click on its window or icon).
3.  Press **`Right Option` + `Right Command` + `[Your Desired Letter]`** on your keyboard. For example, to assign 'F' to Finder, you'd press `Right Option + Right Command + F`.
4.  WarpKey's settings window will pop up, showing your new shortcut. Here, you can choose between "Hide/Unhide" or "Cycle Windows" mode for that app.
5.  To use your new shortcut, simply press **`Right Command` + `[Your Assigned Letter]`** from anywhere on your Mac and watch your app respond instantly!

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **[Download `WarpKey.zip`](https://github.com/your-github-username/WarpKey/releases/latest)** from the latest release.
2.  Unzip the file and drag **`WarpKey.app`** into your `/Applications` folder.
3.  Launch WarpKey. You must **grant Accessibility permissions** when prompted for the hotkeys to work.
