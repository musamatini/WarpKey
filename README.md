WarpKey isn't just another launcher—it's a THE ULTIMATE LAUNCHER for your Mac. Create simple or complex keyboard shortcuts to launch or run anything you need. It's designed to be blazing-fast, intuitive, and is one of the only switchers that can **instantly jump between apps in different spaces or fullscreen apps.**

## ✨ Core Features

*   **🚀 True Window Switching: Beyond the Basics:** Most launchers and switchers fail when apps are on different desktops (Spaces) or in fullscreen. WarpKey's targets windows directly, letting you instantly switch to *any* app, anywhere on your Mac, without hesitation.
*   **⌨️ All Kinds of Hotkeys:** Create shortcuts for almost anything. If you can point to it, you can probably make a hotkey for it.
*   **🎯 Multiple Target Types:**
    *   **Apps (`.app`):** Launch or hide an application with its powerful, direct window switching.
    *   **URLs (`.com`):** Open any web link in your default browser.
    *   **Files & Folders (`.txt`, `📁`):** Open any file or folder instantly.
    *   **Scripts (`>_`):** Execute any shell command, either silently in the background or in a new Terminal window.
    *   **macOS Shortcuts (` Shortcuts`):** Run any of your existing shortcuts from Apple's Shortcuts app.
*   **⚡️ Advanced Triggers:** Go beyond a simple key press. Assign actions to a **Double Press**, **Triple Press**, or a long **Hold** of the same hotkey.
*   **🧑‍💻 Profiles:** Create different sets of shortcuts for different contexts like "Work" 👔, "Gaming" 🎮, or "Design" 🎨 and switch between them easily.
*   **Cheatsheet:** A global hotkey to pop up a beautiful, organized list of all your active shortcuts for the current profile. Never forget a hotkey again!
*   **🪄 Quick Assign:** Use a special hotkey to instantly bring up the recorder for whatever app you're currently focused on.
*   **⚠️ Conflict Detection:** The app cleverly warns you if you've assigned the same hotkey and trigger to multiple actions.
*   **🎨 Customizable UI:** Make WarpKey your own with multiple color themes and support for system light/dark modes.
*   **🔄 Import & Export:** Easily back up your profiles and shortcuts to a file or move your setup to a new Mac.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **[Download `WarpKey.zip`](https://github.com/musamatini/WarpKey/releases/latest)** from the latest release.
2.  Unzip the file and drag **`WarpKey.app`** into your `/Applications` folder.
3.  Launch WarpKey. You will be guided through a one-time setup:
    *   You **must grant Accessibility permissions** for hotkeys to work.
    *   You **should grant Screen Recording permissions** for the best experience. This is **required** to switch to apps on other desktops or in fullscreen. *WarpKey never records your screen*—this permission is only used to locate windows across all spaces.

### How to Use

1.  **➕ Create a Shortcut (Two Ways!):**
    *   **The Standard Way:** From the main window, click the **`+ Add Shortcut`** button at the bottom. This lets you add any type of shortcut.
    *   **The Quick Way (for Apps 🪄):** Use your global "Quick Assign" hotkey (you can set this in **App Settings**) to instantly start creating a shortcut for your currently active application. It's the fastest way to add apps!

2.  **🎯 Pick Your Target:** If you used the standard way, choose what you want to control: an App, a URL, a File/Folder, a Script, or a macOS Shortcut. (The Quick Way automatically selects the app for you).

3.  **🎤 Record Your Hotkey:** After you select your target, the hotkey recorder will appear.
    *   Press and hold the key combination you want (e.g., `⌃ + ⌥ + P`).
    *   Optionally, use the dropdown to select an advanced trigger like **Double Press** or **Hold**.
    *   Click **Done**.

4.  **🔥 Use It Everywhere:** Your hotkey is now active system-wide! Press it anywhere in macOS to trigger your action.

5.  **✏️ Manage Your Shortcuts:** All your shortcuts are listed in the main window. Click the pencil icon to change its hotkey/content or the trash icon to delete it.

6.  **⚙️ Explore Settings:** Click **"App Settings"** to manage profiles, set up the Cheatsheet and Quick Assign hotkeys, and customize the app's appearance.
