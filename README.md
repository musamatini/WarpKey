# üéâ WarpKey: Your Mac's Productivity Power-Up! üöÄ

### Blazing-Fast App Switching & Window Management at Your Fingertips.

Welcome to WarpKey, a sleek and intuitive macOS utility designed to revolutionize how you interact with your applications! Forget endless clicking or searching through docks and menus. With WarpKey, you can instantly launch, hide, or cycle through your apps and their windows with custom, blazing-fast hotkeys, making your workflow smoother and more efficient than ever before.

This project is a labor of love, built with üíö SwiftUI, and it represents my journey as a junior developer diving deep into the world of open-source macOS app development. Your feedback and support mean the world!

## ‚ú® Features That Will Transform Your Workflow

*   **Customizable Hotkeys:** Assign unique, memorable keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Right Option + Right Command + [Letter]`) to your most-used applications. Imagine launching your browser, IDE, or chat app with a single, intuitive key combination!
*   **Two Powerful Shortcut Modes:**
    *   **Hide/Unhide Mode (Default):** The classic behavior. If the app is hidden or in the background, this brings it to the front. If it's already in front, it magically hides the app, decluttering your desktop.
    *   **Cycle Windows Mode:** Perfect for power users! If an app has multiple windows open (think Finder, your web browser, or multiple code editors), this mode intelligently cycles through each open window every time you use the shortcut. No more hunting for that specific window!
*   **Seamless Launch at Login:** Enable WarpKey to automatically start when you log into your Mac, ensuring your personalized shortcuts are always ready to go the moment you need them.
*   **Discrete Menu Bar Integration:** An optional, minimal icon in your macOS menu bar provides quick access to WarpKey's settings without cluttering your Dock.
*   **Elegant macOS Design:** Crafted with attention to detail, WarpKey blends beautifully with your system's aesthetic, featuring modern blurred backgrounds and a clean, easy-to-navigate interface.
*   **Intuitive Onboarding:** A friendly welcome guide ensures you're up and running swiftly, teaching you the magic of WarpKey in no time.
*   **Clear All Shortcuts:** Need a fresh start? Easily remove all your custom assignments with a single click.

## üöÄ Getting Started with WarpKey Magic

It's incredibly simple to set up your first shortcut:

1.  **Launch WarpKey.** (It might appear in your menu bar or as a window).
2.  Bring the application you wish to assign a shortcut to into focus (click on its window or icon).
3.  Now, for the magic! Press the **`Right Option` + `Right Command` + `[Your Desired Letter]`** key combination on your keyboard. For example, to assign 'F' to Finder, you'd press `Right Option + Right Command + F`.
4.  WarpKey's settings window will instantly pop up, showing your newly assigned shortcut. Here, you can easily switch between "Hide/Unhide Mode" and "Cycle Mode" for that specific app.
5.  To use your new blazing-fast shortcut, simply press **`Right Command` + `[Your Assigned Letter]`** from anywhere on your Mac! Watch your apps respond instantly!
