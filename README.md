WrapKey is a lightweight yet powerful macOS utility that puts your entire workflow at your fingertips. Go beyond simple app switching and create custom keyboard shortcuts to launch, hide, or run virtually anything. It's designed to be blazing-fast and intuitive, running discreetly from your menu bar to keep you in the flow.

## ✨ Core Features

*   **🚀 Launch Anything:** Create hotkeys for not just Apps, but also **Files, Folders, URLs, Shell Scripts, and macOS Shortcuts**.
*   **🎹 Per-Type Triggers:** Assign a unique trigger key for each shortcut category (e.g., `⌘` for Apps, `⌥` for URLs) for ultimate organization and control.
*   **🗂️ Profiles:** Create different sets of hotkeys and triggers for different contexts like "Work," "Personal," or "Design." Switch between them instantly.
*   **✏️ Fully Editable:** Edit your shortcuts' content—not just the hotkey. Change a URL, update a script, or point to a new file at any time.
*   **⚠️ Conflict Detection:** WrapKey intelligently detects when a hotkey is assigned to multiple actions, alerts you, and runs *all* of them when pressed.
*   **🔄 Import & Export:** Easily back up your entire configuration, including all profiles and shortcuts, to a JSON file. Perfect for migrating to a new Mac.
*   **🌪️ Blazing Fast & Native:** Built in Swift for macOS, ensuring it's lightweight, fast, and efficient.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **[Download `WrapKey.zip`](https://github.com/musamatini/WrapKey/releases/latest)** from the latest release.
2.  Unzip the file and drag **`WrapKey.app`** into your `/Applications` folder.
3.  Launch WrapKey. You must **grant Accessibility permissions** when prompted for the hotkeys to work.

### How It Works

*   **To Add a Shortcut:**
    1.  Click the WrapKey icon in your menu bar.
    2.  Click the **`+ Add Shortcut`** button and choose a type (URL, File, Script, etc.).
    3.  Follow the prompts and assign a hotkey when asked.

*   **To Assign an App (The Fast Way):**
    1.  Bring the app you want to assign to the very front.
    2.  Press your **`Secondary Key + App Trigger Key + [Letter]`**. (Default: `Right Option + Right Command + [Letter]`).

*   **To Use a Shortcut:**
    *   Press the **`Trigger Key + Assigned Key`** for that shortcut's category.

*   **To Edit a Shortcut:**
    *   Click the pencil icon next to any shortcut. You can choose to **Change Hotkey** or **Edit Content**.
