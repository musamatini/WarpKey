Of course, bro! I've analyzed the Swift code and filled in the `//todo` sections for you. The app has some really neat features!

## ✨ Core Features

*   **⌨️ All Kinds of Hotkeys:** Create shortcuts for almost anything. If you can point to it, you can probably make a hotkey for it.
*   **🎯 Multiple Target Types:**
    *   **Apps (`.app`):** Launch, hide, or cycle through an application's windows.
    *   **URLs (`.com`):** Open any web link in your default browser.
    *   **Files & Folders (`.txt`, `📁`):** Open any file or folder instantly.
    *   **Scripts (`>_`):** Execute any shell command, either silently in the background or in a new Terminal window.
    *   **macOS Shortcuts (` Shortcuts`):** Run any of your existing shortcuts from Apple's Shortcuts app.
*   **⚡️ Advanced Triggers:** Go beyond a simple key press. Assign actions to a **Double Press**, **Triple Press**, or a long **Hold** of the same hotkey.
*   **🧑‍💻 Profiles:** Create different sets of shortcuts for different contexts like "Work" 👔, "Gaming" 🎮, or "Design" 🎨 and switch between them easily.
*   ** cheat-sheet** A global hotkey to pop up a beautiful, organized list of all your active shortcuts for the current profile. Never forget a hotkey again!
*   **🪄 Quick Assign:** Use a special hotkey to instantly bring up the recorder for whatever app you're currently focused on.
*   **⚠️ Conflict Detection:** The app cleverly warns you if you've assigned the same hotkey and trigger to multiple actions.
*   **🎨 Customizable UI:** Make WrapKey your own with multiple color themes and support for system light/dark modes.
*   **🔄 Import & Export:** Easily back up your profiles and shortcuts to a file or move your setup to a new Mac.
