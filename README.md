WrapKey is a lightweight macOS utility that lets you launch, hide, and switch between your most-used applications with custom keyboard shortcuts. It's designed to be blazing-fast and intuitive, running discreetly from your menu bar to keep your workflow smooth and your desktop clean.

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **[Download `WrapKey.zip`](https://github.com/musamatini/WrapKey/releases/latest)** from the latest release.
2.  Unzip the file and drag **`WrapKey.app`** into your `/Applications` folder.
3.  Launch WrapKey. You must **grant Accessibility permissions** when prompted for the hotkeys to work.

## ✨ How It Works

1.  **Focus** the app you want to assign a shortcut to.
2.  **Set the shortcut** by pressing `Right Option + Right Command + [Letter]`.
3.  **Use the shortcut** anytime by pressing `Right Command + [Letter]`.

That's it! You can manage your shortcuts and their modes (Hide/Unhide vs. Cycle Windows) from the WrapKey settings window, accessible from the menu bar.

## 👨‍💻 For Developers (Build from Source)

1.  Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/musamatini/WrapKey.git`
2.  Open `WrapKey.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the project.
